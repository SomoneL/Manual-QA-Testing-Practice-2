# Manual-Testing-Practice-2
Conducted Smoke Testing, Integration Testing, and System Testing on 3 different applications. I used Jira to track any bugs found.

Three applications used:

Website: www.travelguzs.com
Website: www.demoblaze.com
Salesforce Application: Budget Bestie




Scenario: 



-	Task: Conduct 3 different tests with 1 being recorded across 3 applications, document the actual results within & track any bugs and defects found in Jira.

-	Tests I have decided to execute: 

Smoke Testing -  Initial test to make sure major functionalities are working, and checking for major breakdowns in the application.

Integration Testing -  Checking that all the modules are combined and working successfully.

System Testing -  End to End testing, testing the application for its compliance to functional and non-functional tests.
